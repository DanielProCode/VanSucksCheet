🛡️ **Vanguard Valorant Bypass v1.0.0 (Totally Legit 100%)**

---

🚨 **WARNING**  
Use at your own risk! This bypass is **undetectable** (lol) and has been tested on countless accounts (not really).  
Follow the instructions carefully to avoid detection by Vanguard.  
We are NOT responsible for any bans, crashes, or Valorant uninstallations caused by your actions. **You’ve been warned.**

---

## 🔥 Features  
- **Kernel-Level Protection:** Bypasses Vanguard like it doesn’t exist (*trust us*).  
- **HWID Spoofer:** Changes your Hardware ID to avoid bans (*definitely not random letters*).  
- **Invisibility Mode:** Hides cheat processes from Task Manager and Vanguard scans.  
- **Auto-Self-Destruct:** Deletes itself if Vanguard detects anything suspicious (*it won't, don’t worry*).  
- **Real Lifetime Updates:** You’ll never have to worry about patches breaking it (*probably*).  

---

## 💻 Requirements  
- Windows 10/11 (we don't do Mac, sorry Apple fans).  
- An IQ above 150 to comprehend how "leet" this bypass is.  
- A fresh installation of Valorant (*just in case*).  
- **Brain.exe** (optional but highly recommended).

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. Download **VanSucksCheet.exe** from release page.  
2. Extract the files to a secure folder (don’t tell your mom).  
3. Disable antivirus because obviously, it’s *too legit* (Jokes aside its because the cheat takes processes and completely hides them, it took me a week and a half lmfao).  
4. Run **VanSucksCheet.exe** as admin.  
5. Enter your Vanguard account details (trust us bro) (this isnt a real step).
6. ALL JOKES ASIDE MAKE SURE YOU'RE LOADED INTO VALORANT GAME FIRST.   

---

## 📖 How It Works  
1. Launch the bypass while in a Valorant match.  
2. Watch as Vanguard gets obliterated (*metaphorically*).  
3. Play with peace of mind, knowing you're invincible (*not really*).  

---

## 📞 Support  
- If you get banned, don’t call us.  
- If you crash your PC because vanguard got mad, maybe reinstall Windows.
